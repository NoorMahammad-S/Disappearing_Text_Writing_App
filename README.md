# Disappearing Text Writing App

This application built using the tkinter library. It provides a minimalistic text editor with a unique feature â€“ text disappears after a certain idle period.

## Features

- Write and edit text as you would with any text editor.
- Text automatically disappears after 5 seconds of idle time.
- Save your text to a file.
- Load previously saved text from a file.
- Confirm before deleting all text.

## How to Use

1. Run the application by executing the Python script.
2. Type or paste text in the text widget.
3. The text will automatically disappear if you leave it idle for 5 seconds.
4. Use the "File" menu to save and load text.
5. Use the "Edit" menu to delete all text.

## File Structure

- `app.py`: The main Python script containing the application code.
- `saved_text.txt`: The file where the text is saved.
- `.gitignore`: A Git configuration file to specify ignored files and directories.

## Usage

```
